# Django Project

This project is a basic forum (boards) which include some categories. Inside each board, user can start a new discussion by creating new topic. 
In each topic created, the users can replay and participate in the discussion.
Only the Admin user can create a new board.

we have the following models:
  - Board
  - Topic
  - Post
  - User

* [jQuery] - JavaScript library

## How to run the code?
